## Introduction

In this project, we embark on a journey to understand various Zero-knowledge proof systems, 
highlighting a consistent benchmark analysis of Poseidon across multiple circuits. 
While there are several other benchmarking tools available, we chose Poseidon due to its unique design, 
which offers fewer constraints in the circuit. This results in quicker proving times and possibly reduced proof sizes. 
We aim to meticulously evaluate Poseidonâ€™s efficiency on zk-SNARK and zk-STARK circuit platforms like Nova, Halo2, Starky, and Plonky2. 
Through this comparison, we seek a holistic understanding of the advantages and drawbacks of each platform. 
Armed with this insight, we hope to determine the best framework tailored to our requirements.
